## Today I am still working on binary trees

# Binary Tree Paths

  print all the tree paths from root to leaf!
  For example, given the following binary tree:

       1
     /   \
    2     3
     \
      5
    All root-to-leaf paths are:

    ["1->2->5", "1->3"]

```python
 """
Definition of TreeNode:
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val):
        self.val = val
        self.left, self.right = None, None
"""


class Solution:
    """
    @param: root: the root of the binary tree
    @return: all root-to-leaf paths
    """
    def binaryTreePaths(self, root):
        # write your code here
        self.results=[]
        if root is None:
            return self.results
        self.print_path(root,"")
        return self.results
        
        
    def print_path(self,node,path):
        if node.left is None and node.right is None:
            self.results.append(path+str(node.val))
        if node.left:
            self.print_path(node.left,path+str(node.val)+'->')
            
        if node.right:
            self.print_path(node.right,path+str(node.val)+'->')
```
It takes me hours to solve it. I know it's going to use recusive function to visit each node, if it's a leaf then add the value,
if it is not a leaf, then should add value and '->'
the difficulty is how to expend this string, and when we finish each path, we should add this string into a list.

## for all recusive problem, we should consider
* which is the exit(base case)
* each time recusion, what is the little change
* your problem should shrink after each recusion, and ultimately to the exit

in this particular problem:
the exit is print the leaf. 
for other nodes, they only need to print itself and "->" then call to print its subtrees

logic is easy, but I guess it still has a long way to go to master recursion
