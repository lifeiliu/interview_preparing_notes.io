  *[leetcode 257] (https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-paths/description/)

  print all the tree paths from root to leaf!
  For example, given the following binary tree:

       1
     /   \
    2     3
     \
      5
    All root-to-leaf paths are:

    ["1->2->5", "1->3"]


    ``` python

    ```
