# subsets 
[leetcode 17](http://www.lintcode.com/en/problem/subsets/)

## how to think to solve this problem:
### 1. what category? 
* data structure?
* search?
* sort?
* BFS
* DFS
* DP?

figure it out that it can be solved by BFS and DFS
### 2. ask the interviewer how would he/she like you to solve it? 
by the way, the space complexity of BFS is larger than DFS
BFS depends on the widthest lever
DFS depends on the deepest of the recursion tree

```buildoutcfg
BFS            []
         [1]  =>    [2] =>   [3]
     => [1,2][1,3] =>[2][3]
     =>[1,2,3]
DFS                     []     
             go down       down           down
              [1]   up      [2]    up      [3]
             go down        down
           [1,2] [1,3]  up    [2,3] up
              go down 
             [1,2,3]   up        
```
