  # 66 Binary Tree Preorder Traversal
[click to get the web]( http://www.lintcode.com/en/problem/binary-tree-preorder-traversal/)
needs to return the value of node in a list
ex.[1,2,3,4,5]
could use recursive and non-recusive(which is harder)

## my notes:
### 1. how to use recursion to traverse a binary tree:

``` python
  def traverse(node):
    if node is None:
      return
    else:
      print node.val
      traverse(node.left)
      traverse(node.right)
```
### 2. in this particular question, it needs to return a list that containing the value of each node
   to do this, we need to create a list, append the value of each node while we traverse the tree, and return it at the end
   in this case.it has to be a member val. of the class, and call the function traverse in the other function
   ```python
   """
    Definition of TreeNode:
    class TreeNode:
        def __init__(self, val):
            self.val = val
            self.left, self.right = None, None
    """


    class Solution:
        """
        @param: root: A Tree
        @return: Preorder in ArrayList which contains node values.
        """
        def preorderTraversal(self, root):
          self.result=[]
          self.traverse(root)
          return result
        
        def traverse(self,node):
          if node is None:
            return 
          else:
            self.result.append(node.val)
            self.traverse(node.left)
            self.traverse(node.right)
    ```
    
    ### 3. One thing I would like to highlight is that remember to use **self** when call function or member variavle in a class
    I made this misstake of missing this **self** and it turns out compiling error
